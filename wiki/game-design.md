>**Game Design Document Outline**

## Overview 📚

Torus is a top-down 2D space shooter. Build and upgrade your spaceship, raid derelict stations and survive the harsh environments you encounter.

### Genre 

Space Shooter

### Target Audience

People who like hard-core pvp and infuriating survival games. 

### Game Flow Summary

How does the player move through the game.   Both through framing interface and the game itself.

### Game Style

The visual theme is minimalistic, with a focus on clean visuals and intuitive art. Science and technology is futuristic, but with a grounded sense of realism and plausibility.
The overall theme should feel like a dystopian space shoot'em-up, with in-depth customization for characters and their gear. Partial progression between raids, but with the potential to loose it all and start again making every raid count!
