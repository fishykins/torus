# Game Design Document
>**Game Design Document Outline**

*A game design document is a blueprint from which a game is to be built.  As such, every single detail necessary to build the game should be addressed.  The larger the team and the longer the design and development cycle, the more critical is the need.  For your purpose, the intent is to capture as much as possible of your design.  I want you to think bigâ€¦bigger than what you are able to develop.  I also want you to be clear about what the software delivers and what the design entails.  My recommendation is that you define the ultimate game and then clarify what it is that you have developed.  If you are finding it too difficult to do that, you may produce too documents.*

## Overview

Torus is a top-down 2D space shooter. Build and upgrade your spaceship, raid derelict stations and survive the harsh environments you encounter.

### Genre

Space Shooter

### Target Audience

People who like hard-core pvp and infuriating survival games. 

### Game Flow Summary

How does the player move through the game.   Both through framing interface and the game itself.

### Look and Feel

The visual theme is minimalistic, with a focus on clean visuals and intuitive art. Science and technology is futuristic, but with a grounded sense of realism and plausibility.
The overall theme should feel like a dystopian space shoot'em-up, with in-depth customization for characters and their gear. Partial progression between raids, but with the potential to loose it all and start again making every raid count!
